# Nemotron 3.5 Lightning 30B-A3B on Apple Silicon

This folder adapts the repository to a Mac with Apple Silicon. It was tested on a MacBook Pro with an
**M4 Pro (10 P-cores, 20-core GPU) and 24 GB of unified memory**, macOS 26.7, and Homebrew llama.cpp
build 10809 (`5266f24da`), with `NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-Q4_0.gguf` from `ggml-org`.

The upstream optimizations are for one AMD Zen 5 CPU without a GPU. On a Mac, the Metal GPU does the
work, and the memory bandwidth is 273 GB/s (not approximately 75 GB/s). Thus most of the upstream
changes do not apply, and the limit is the size of the memory, not the bandwidth. For the Q4_0 file
measured below, stock llama.cpp is sufficient and no patch is necessary. This does not hold for the
Fractal-64 (`Q2_0`) GGUFs, see the next section.

## Fractal-64 (`Q2_0`) GGUFs

A Fractal-64 GGUF (for example `NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-30B-A3B-Fractal-64.gguf`) stores `Q2_0` tensors in a
30-byte block of 64 weights. Stock llama.cpp sizes `Q2_0` with an 18-byte block and cannot read the file:
Homebrew llama.cpp (ggml 0.19.0) exits with `gguf_init_from_reader: tensor 'blk.1.ffn_down_shexp.weight' has
offset 899308800, expected 779574528`. Build the patched engine instead:

```bash
BUILD_TESTS=1 ./apple-silicon/setup.sh      # BUILD_TESTS=1 also builds test-quantize-fns and test-backend-ops
```

`scripts/build_zen5_llama.sh` applies `patches/zen5-nemotron-256k-optimizations.patch`, `patches/lut-vq3-64-avx512-vbmi.patch` (`GGML_TYPE_VQ3_0 = 43` with portable C fallback), and, on macOS, the patches in
`patches/nemotron-apple-silicon/`: a faster single-row (decode) `Q2_0` Metal kernel (a 4-thread block layout
plus a 512-byte threadgroup pair-lookup table for the codebook, [PR #24](https://github.com/synchopate/llama-modchip/pull/24)), the `Q2_0` block size in
`gguf-py`, and tighter `Q2_0` tests (including a random-block dot product test that also covers the armv8.0 NEON
branch when built with `-DGGML_NATIVE=OFF -DGGML_CPU_ARM_ARCH=armv8-a`, and `test-backend-ops` cases with random
raw `Q2_0` blocks). Note that on Apple Silicon Macs, prefer the `Fractal-64` (`Q2_0 = 42`) GGUFs over `LUT-VQ3-64` (`VQ3_0 = 43`), as `Q2_0` runs natively on Metal whereas `VQ3_0` targets x86-64 AVX-512 VBMI CPUs. On other systems these macOS patches are not applied, so a Linux build is unchanged; set
`APPLE_SILICON_PATCHES=1` to apply them anyway or `=0` to leave them out on a Mac. If an earlier run was interrupted and left only part of the series
applied, the script stops without changing anything; `RESET_LLAMA_TREE=1` discards the uncommitted changes in the
llama.cpp clone and applies everything again. The patch files have no mail
headers: they are meant for `git apply` (as the script does), not `git am`. Check a build, from the llama.cpp
directory, with `build/bin/test-quantize-fns` and `build/bin/test-backend-ops test -b MTL0 -p q2_0`. These patches
only change the `Q2_0` Metal kernel, `gguf-py` and the tests; the other backends and CPU architectures were not
audited. They apply to the Nemotron patch only, not to the DeepSeek-V4 patch stack in `patches/apple-silicon/`.

## Results

All numbers are from the M4 Pro (24 GB) with `iogpu.wired_limit_mb=20480`, flash attention, and a
q8_0 KV cache. The model uses all 6 experts per token.

### Compared with the upstream Zen 5 numbers

| Measurement | Zen 5 CPU (upstream README) | M4 Pro (this folder) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Prefill, short prompt | 306.8 tok/s | **777 tok/s** (batch 1024), 829 tok/s (batch 2048) |
| Decode, short context | 25.3–32.7 tok/s (with only 4 of 6 experts) | **56.9 tok/s** |
| Prefill at approximately 30K context | 156.9–170.8 tok/s (4K sliding window) | **524 tok/s** (full attention) |
| Decode at approximately 30K context | < 15 tok/s (full attention), 50.5 tok/s (4K window + speculation) | **49.0 tok/s** (full attention, no speculation) |
| Code edit with n-gram speculation | 50.5–65.0 tok/s | **154.6 tok/s** (`ngram-mod`) |

### Context depth (`./bench.sh depth`, batch size 1024)

| Context depth | Prefill (2048 tokens) | Decode |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 777 tok/s | 56.9 tok/s |
| 8K | 698 tok/s | 54.4 tok/s |
| 32K | 524 tok/s | 49.0 tok/s |
| 128K | 207 tok/s | 30.3 tok/s |

From these rates, a cold 128K prompt needs approximately 5 minutes (calculated, not measured as one
request). In an agent loop, the prompt cache prevents most cold prefills (see below).

### GPU placement (`./bench.sh placement`, prompt 2048, decode 128)

| `--n-cpu-moe` | MoE layers on the CPU | Prefill, batch 512 / 2048 | Decode |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0 | 696 / 829 tok/s | 57.0 tok/s |
| 4 | 2 | 603 / 707 tok/s | 57–59 tok/s |
| 7 | 3 | 325 / 250 tok/s | 34–51 tok/s (not stable, swap) |

`--n-cpu-moe N` counts all layers, not only MoE layers. In this model, the first MoE layers are 1, 3,
6 and 8.

### Speculative decoding (`./bench_spec.sh`, greedy, thinking off)

| Mode | Code edit (copy a file with one change) | New code | Text |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| none | 55.3 tok/s | 56.2 tok/s | 56.3 tok/s |
| **`ngram-mod`** (default of `run-server.sh`) | **154.6 tok/s** (93% accepted) | 56.1 tok/s | 56.1 tok/s |
| `ngram-simple`, upstream settings (n=4, m=5) | 89.7 tok/s | 54.5 tok/s | 55.4 tok/s |
| `draft-mtp`, 1 draft token (*) | 75.2 tok/s | 61.7 tok/s | 63.7 tok/s |
| `draft-mtp`, 3 draft tokens (*) | 66.2 tok/s | 46.7 tok/s | 27.4 tok/s |

(*) With the default settings, MTP stopped with a Metal out-of-memory error. The MTP head needs
approximately 1.1 GiB more. MTP ran only with `N_CPU_MOE=4 UBATCH=512 CTX=32768`, and then the
prefill was half as fast (327 tok/s). On a 24 GB Mac, `ngram-mod` is the better choice. On a Mac
with more memory, try `SPEC=mtp ... --spec-draft-n-max 1`.

### Agent loop (`agent_loop_test.py`, approximately 20K tokens of system prompt and tool schemas)

| Turn | New prompt tokens | From the cache | TTFT |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1, cold | 20,419 | 0 | 29.9 s |
| 2, after a tool result of approximately 1K tokens | 990 | 20,444 | 1.86 s |
| 3, after a short tool result | 54 | 21,430 | 0.33 s |

These numbers are for direct mode. The gateway mode gave the same values (0.33 s for 54 new tokens).
Each warm turn costs approximately 1.7 ms per new token. llama-server makes the Mamba-2 checkpoints
at the start of the last user message and near the end of the prompt, so a turn that only adds
messages does not process the prefix again.

## What applies to a Mac

| Upstream optimization | On Apple Silicon |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hybrid Mamba-2 + MoE model (6 attention layers) | **Applies.** It is the reason that a long context fits. |
| q4_0 KV cache | Applies, but q8_0 is used here. At 128K, q8_0 needs only 410 MiB. |
| Built-in n-gram speculation | Applies. Use `ngram-mod`, not the upstream `ngram-simple` settings. |
| `--cache-reuse`, context checkpoints, `/v1/messages` gateway | Applies. The gateway needed fixes (see below). |
| Sliding-window attention patch (`ggml-cpu/ops.cpp`) | **No effect.** Metal kernels do the attention, not the CPU code. |
| `_MM_HINT_NTA` prefetch (`ops.cpp`, `arch/x86/quants.c`) | **No effect.** x86 only. |
| AVX-512 VNNI `q4_0_8x8` repack | **No effect.** x86 only. The Metal backend has its own kernels. |
| 2 MB transparent hugepages | **No effect.** Linux only. macOS uses 16 KB pages, and the GPU has its own page tables. |
| Dual-CCD OpenMP pinning | **No effect.** There are no CCDs, and the CPU does almost no work. |
| RouteCrack + Stockfish-PVS draftless speculation (`speculative/cpp/`) | Optional on CPU; on Metal GPU, stock `llama.cpp` `ngram-mod` and `draft-mtp` are used (see the results). |
| HARP-Cache (`kv_cache/harp_cache.py`) | Disabled automatically on macOS (macOS has no `/dev/shm` tmpfs). |
| Asymmetric EAKV (`--cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q4_0`) | Supported, though symmetric `q8_0` is used here since at 128K it takes only 410 MiB. |

## Memory budget (24 GB Mac)

From the llama.cpp logs, 128K context, q8_0 KV cache:

| Item | MiB |
| :--- | ---: |
| Model weights on the GPU (`MTL0_Mapped`) | 18,015 |
| Token embeddings on the CPU (`CPU_Mapped`) | 357 |
| KV cache, 6 attention layers, 131,584 cells | 410 |
| Mamba-2 recurrent state (23 layers) | 48 |
| GPU compute buffer, batch size 2048 | 1,826 |
| GPU compute buffer, batch size 1024 | 534 |

With a batch size of 2048, a 128K prompt stopped with `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`.
Thus `run-server.sh` uses 1024. It also sets a 1 GiB prompt cache (`--cache-ram`, default 8 GiB) and 8
context checkpoints (default 32, each checkpoint holds approximately 48 MiB of Mamba-2 state).

By default, Metal can use 18,186 MiB on a 24 GB Mac. That is not sufficient for all weights. You can
raise the limit until the next restart:

```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=20480
```

If you do not raise the limit, `--fit` (on by default) keeps some MoE layers on the CPU side. That works,
but the prefill is slower (see the placement results).

**Caution:** The server uses approximately 18.5 GiB RSS. While it runs, macOS moves the memory of other
apps to swap (1.7–3.7 GiB in the tests) and memory pressure is high, so these apps can become slow.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `run-server.sh` | Starts `llama-server` with the tuned settings. Environment variables change the context size, the speculation mode, the batch size, and the gateway mode. |
| `bench.sh` | `llama-bench` runs: GPU placement and batch size, and speed at context depths. |
| `bench_spec.sh`, `bench_server.py` | Compare the speculation modes on code and text tasks. |
| `run-gateway.sh`, `system_prompt.macos.md` | Start `gateway/sse_gateway.py` for Claude Code on macOS. |
| `agent_loop_test.py` | Multi-turn tool test (Anthropic API). It shows the TTFT and the cache hits of each turn. |
| `results/` | Benchmark tables and logs from the M4 Pro. |

## Quick start

1. Download the model (18.9 GB) into the LM Studio model folder:

   ```bash
   DEST=~/.lmstudio/models/ggml-org/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-GGUF
   mkdir -p "$DEST"
   curl -L -C - -o "$DEST/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-Q4_0.gguf" \
     https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-GGUF/resolve/main/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-Q4_0.gguf
   shasum -a 256 "$DEST/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-Q4_0.gguf"
   ```

   The SHA-256 must be `61f87e75974e4b535dcdf9aad056541a9514f1dfa4538b463b081d19b7a00e3c`.
   The MTP head (`mtp-NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-Q4_0.gguf`, 1.16 GB) is only necessary for `SPEC=mtp`.

2. Optional: raise the Metal memory limit (see above).

3. Start the server. It listens on `127.0.0.1:8789` and also serves the llama.cpp web UI:

   ```bash
   ./run-server.sh
   ```

4. Use Claude Code with the local model. Select one of these two modes.

   - **Direct mode** (no gateway). llama-server parses the tool calls itself:

     ```bash
     ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8789 ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=local ANTHROPIC_MODEL=nemotron-3.5-30b-a3b claude
     ```

   - **Gateway mode.** The gateway replaces the Claude Code system prompt with the short
     `system_prompt.macos.md`, removes `<system-reminder>` blocks, and adds the `/think no|med|max`
     command. Start the server with raw output, then the gateway:

     ```bash
     GATEWAY=1 ./run-server.sh
     ```

     ```bash
     ./run-gateway.sh
     ```

     ```bash
     ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=local ANTHROPIC_MODEL=nemotron-3.5-30b-a3b claude
     ```

   The two modes were tested at the API level with `agent_loop_test.py`. A full interactive Claude Code
   session was not tested.

## Gateway changes in this branch

`gateway/sse_gateway.py` had these problems on a Mac, and some of them also on Linux:

- **Tool calls from Nemotron 3.5 were lost.** The model writes tool calls in XML
  (`<tool_call><function=Read><parameter=file_path>…`), but the gateway parsed only JSON. The gateway
  then sent the fallback text `Task completed.` in place of the tool call. The gateway now also parses
  the XML format. It converts each value to the type in the tool schema (integer, number, boolean,
  array, object), because Claude Code rejects `"true"` for a boolean parameter.
- **Shell injection in `Write`.** The path was put in `'…'` without escapes. A path such as
  `x'; touch y #` ran the second command. The path now goes through `shlex.quote`.
- **Network exposure.** The gateway listened on `0.0.0.0` with CORS `*`. It now listens on `127.0.0.1`
  (`GATEWAY_HOST` changes this) and sends CORS headers only if `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGIN` is set.
  `run-server.sh` sets `--cors-origins localhost` for the same reason. The llama-server default is
  `*` with credentials.
- **HARP-Cache on macOS.** Without `/dev/shm`, it allocated a 512 MiB heap buffer. It is now skipped when
  `/dev/shm` does not exist, or when `HARP_CACHE=0`.
- **System prompt.** The upstream prompt describes the Linux setup of the author. `GATEWAY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
  now selects the file, and `run-gateway.sh` uses `system_prompt.macos.md`.

The gateway still has these upstream behaviours. Know them before you use it:

- It changes each `Write` call into a `Bash` command (`echo '<base64>' | base64 -d > <path>`). Thus
  Claude Code asks for Bash permission and shows no file diff.
- It allows a maximum of 2 tool calls per turn and limits `max_tokens` to 4096.
- It replaces the full Claude Code system prompt with the short gateway prompt.

## DeepSeek-V4-Flash 284B on Apple Silicon (M5 Max 64 GB)

Contributed by Bobby Grayson ([`@notactuallytreyanastasio`](https://github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio)), this repository includes full support, build automation, Metal/NEON kernels, and memory mapping optimizations for running the **`DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-Fractal` (284B, 56.56 GiB)** model on Apple Silicon Macs.

### Key Performance Highlights (Apple M5 Max 64 GB)
- **`llama-bench` (`tg128`)**: **`27.0 ± 0.4 tok/s`** (`pp512`: **`169.4 ± 29.6 tok/s`**)
- **`llama-server` (Realistic Workloads)**: **`20.7 – 23.6 tok/s`** served with **`0` swapouts** (`code_edit`: 20.7 t/s, `code_new`: 23.3 t/s, `free_text`: 23.6 t/s).
- Detailed report and profiling data: [`apple-silicon/results/dsv4-m5max.md`](results/dsv4-m5max.md).

### The Five Engineering Fixes for Apple Silicon
1. **Pinned Upstream Commit**: `patches/dsv4-64gb-cpu.patch` matches llama.cpp commit `d2f83055` (2026-08-10, recovered from the 18 pre-image blob hashes in the patch). Automated worktree setup is handled in [`build-dsv4-engine.sh`](build-dsv4-engine.sh).
2. **Fractal-64 Q2_0 NEON & Metal Kernels**: [`patches/apple-silicon/0001-fractal64-q2_0-arm64-metal.patch`](../patches/apple-silicon/0001-fractal64-q2_0-arm64-metal.patch) rewrites `block_q2_0` (30 bytes: `d`, `scales[4]`, `qs[16]`, `qh[8]`, 3.75 bpw) for ARM64 NEON with dotprod (`vqtbl1q_s8` + `vdotq_s32`) and Metal shaders, resolving undefined symbol link failures off x86 and passing 45/45 `test-backend-ops` MUL_MAT tests (with the scalar reference validated in `test-quantize-fns`).
3. **Metal Host-Pointer Run Mapping**: [`patches/apple-silicon/0002-metal-map-tensor-runs.patch`](../patches/apple-silicon/0002-metal-map-tensor-runs.patch) wraps only contiguous runs of GPU-resident tensors in Metal host-pointer buffers (`newBufferWithBytesNoCopy`, merging gaps < 16 MiB) instead of wrapping the entire mapped file. This prevents CPU-routed experts from exhausting Metal's recommended max working set limit and eliminates `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`.
4. **Metal Register Unpack & Computed LUT**: [`patches/apple-silicon/0003-metal-q2_0-register-unpack.patch`](../patches/apple-silicon/0003-metal-q2_0-register-unpack.patch) unpacks 30-byte blocks using 32-bit word loads via ushort pairs and computes `kvalues_fractal3` directly to avoid SIMD warp-divergent constant memory stalls.
5. **Layer Placement Strategy**: Offloading 5 alternating middle pure-`IQ1_S` layers (`blk.(10|12|14|16|18).ffn_.*_exps.=CPU`) to CPU doubles decode speed from 13.6 tok/s (naive sequential `--n-cpu-moe 4`) to **27.0 tok/s** in `llama-bench` (`tg128`).

### Building and Running
```bash
# 1. Build the engine (clones/worktrees llama.cpp d2f83055 and applies patches)
./apple-silicon/build-dsv4-engine.sh

# 2. Run with fast profile (requires 64 GB Mac + sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=57344)
./apple-silicon/run-dsv4.sh

# Or run with nosudo profile (fits default 53 GB Metal working set)
PROFILE=nosudo ./apple-silicon/run-dsv4.sh
```
